# Karousel 1.0
It's a lightweight carousel,built using the javascript jQuery library. Karousel was designed to be a dynamic lightweight utility that gives webdesigners a powerful way of enhancing a website's user interface.

## Usage
Karousel follows a very simple pattern. A wrapping div containing .karousel-content elements that in turn can contain anything you want.

``` html
<div id="#banner">
<div class="karousel-content">
  <div> </div>
  <div> </div>
  <div> </div>
</div>
</div>
```

Trigger karousel just like any other jQuery plugin just query the element you want to make a karousel and use the karousel() function.

``` js

$("#banner").karousel();

```

## Options

Optionally you can pass an array of options while triggering karousel to customize it to your needs. 

- **pager** Boolean *(default:true)* - a flag indicating if you want to display a pager for the carousel.

-	**cyclic** Boolean *(default:false)* - a flag indicating if you want to display the carousel in a loop , i.e cyclic.

- **automate** Boolean *(default:false)* - a flag indicating if you would like to auto scroll through the carousel.

-	**vertical** Integer *(default:4000)* - a flag indicating if you would like to use a vertical slider. 




## Example

``` js

$("#banner").karousel({
	pager: true,
  automate: true,
  vertical: true,
  cyclic: true
});

```

## Enhancements
My goal is to keep this plugin as simple as possible but 2 possible enhancements I may add are:

- 1:1 swipe movement when using slide animations.

- optional callback after each slide transition could be helpful.

If there is something else you would like added or you notice any issues with this plugin please let me know via [Facebook](http://facebook.com/kumarappan.arumugam) or [GitHub](http://github.com/kumarappanA).
